<center><font size=2><p>_Studing on Master Degree of CS in an American small city_<br/>_Loving Dreaming · Loving Money · Loving Life_ </p></font></center><p>I always wanted to have my own website, and this time I finally built one. My level of front-end design is really bad although my major is cs. It's a shame that my only practice of web design is a final project on my freshman year when, emmmm, I was a ambitious young boy. At that time, I was not like now I am suffering from vicissitudes. Hahaha, that's just a joke. Under this premise, let's get down to business, the BLOG based on Hexo and many excellent blogs, since, you know, I had to stand on the shoulders of giants. After lots of difficulties, whatever, I succeeded reluctantly.</p><p>This website is only a place where I can take the liberty to release myself. I don't care if anyone could read my blogs or how many people could read them. Of course, everyone is welcome to visit my page and I'm willing to share my experience, but the most function of the Blog is recording my life for myself.</p><p>There are some blogs written in English, ~~some are written in Chinese, and some are in both. Chinese articles, in general, always talk about useful experience of Chinese students' life in the USA~~.</p><p>At last, the video above is made to be a tribute to **Star Trek**, and to all who wanna walk on stars, like me.</p><center><font size=3 color="#00FF00"><p>_Live long and prosper._</p></font></center>
