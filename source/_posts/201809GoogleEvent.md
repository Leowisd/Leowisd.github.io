## Interview

### Interview Format

_Technical interviews are by phone, on-campus, or on-site at a Google office. Each interview lasts about 45 mins._
* Step 1: Short Introductions 5 MINS
* Step 2: Technical Assessment 35 MINS
* Step 3: Closing Questions 5 MINS

### Communication and Presentation

_Verbalize your thoughts_
* Restate the question to confirm understanding
* Ask clarifying questions
* Think out loud
* Draw pictures to help visualize your solution (graph)
* Prefer to think in silence? Say so, then summarize

_Listen to your interviewer_
* They want you to succeed
* View session as a "discussion" rather than an "inerview"
* Are they providing a hint?

### Specific details for phone interviews

If you have a phone interview, you'll type yout solutions (code!) into a Google Doc shared with your interviewr.
* Find a quiet location----45 MINS
* Use **Courier New** font for coding
* Charge your cellphone and computer
* Have pen/paper ready to scribble notes
* Share your thoughts out loud
* Remember to manually indent
* Don't search for reference/the question

### Don't forget about testing
* Run through an example
* Enumerate evil inputs-find edge cases!
* Discuss how your code will crash, fall, run infinity, overflow the stack, etc
* Analyze complexity (runtime and space)
* Do a walkthrough of the code with interviewer
* Discuss improvements or alternative solutions

### Possible spin-off questions

**Code: CAn you do it faster?**
* If you think the answer is "no", can you justify it?
* If the answer is "yes", can you explain it?
* What about optimizations that don't change asymptotic complexity?

**Code: Can you parallelize this?**

**Code: What about non-rectangular maps?**

**Design: Can you think of a different "fairness" criteria? Try to defend it.**

### Final Tips
