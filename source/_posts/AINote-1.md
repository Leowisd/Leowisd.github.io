## Intelligent Agent

**Definition**: An intelligent agent **perceives** its **environment** via **sensors** and acts **rationally** upon that environment with its **actuators**.

**Note**: The agent function will internally be represented by the agent program.

## Key Application of AI

* FINANCE
* ROBOiCS
* GAMES
* MEDICINE
* THE WEB

## Rationality Agent

**Definition**: A rational agent chooses whichever action **maximizes the expected value of the performance measure** given the percept sequence to date and prior environment knowledge.

**Note**: Performance measure according to what is wanted in the environment instead of how the agents should behave.

**Note**: What a ratinal at a given time depends on four things:
* Performance measure
* Prior environment knowledge
* Actions
* Percept sequence to date(sencors)
ationality != Omniscience, Rationality != Perfection

## Environment Types(important attributes of AI)
* **Fully Observable** versus **Partially Observable**
    Fully Observable means agent can get all infomation based on current state
    Partially Observable means agent needs memory
* **Deterministic** versus **Stochastic**
    Deterministic means the init environment is not random, such as chess
    Stochastic means the init environment is random, such as Poker game
* **Discrete** versus **Continuous**
    Discrete means limited chooses
    Continuous means unlimitied
* **Beuign** versus **Adversarial**
* **Static** versus **Dynamic**
* Single-agent
* Episodic


## Agent types
### There are 4 basic kind of agent programs
* **Simple reflex agents**

* **Model-based reflex agents**

* **Goal-based agents**

* **Utility-based agents**

**ALL these can be turned into learning agents.**
